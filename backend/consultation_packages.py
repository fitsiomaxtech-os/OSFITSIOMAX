"""The three packages a Physiotherapy consultation is sold as, and how long each one runs.

The Physiotherapy consultation shelf is not named freely any more. It is one of three
packages, and how long an appointment runs follows from which one was sold rather than from
somebody picking minutes off a row of buttons beside the name. So the package is the input
and the duration is derived from it.

Derived, never accepted from the client, for the same reason price_is_total is: the name on
the row says what was sold and the duration says how much of a physio's day to block out
for it. A client free to send both could store a "Consultation + 20 mins Physio" that books
fifteen minutes, and nothing downstream could tell which of the two was the lie.

Kept in its own module, free of FastAPI and of the database, so the arithmetic that decides
how much of a calendar an appointment takes can be read and tested on its own. Same
arrangement as lead_mapping and branch_routing.

The popup mirrors this table (CONSULTATION_PACKAGES in frontend PackagesBoard.jsx) to draw
the dropdown and preview the length. This side is the authority: it re-derives the duration
on the way in and ignores whatever the form sent for it, so the two can disagree about the
wording without ever disagreeing about the minutes.
