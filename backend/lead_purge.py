"""Deleting a patient outright: what goes with them, and whether the button is offered.

Two things live here because they are two halves of one decision.

**The wipe.** Every board in the OS keeps its own trail keyed on `lead_id` — Branch
Leads' activity, remarks and follow-ups, the appointment, Physio's treatment days and
reviews, Diet, Rehab, Zumba, Fitness, the fee reminders raised off the payment plan,
the client portal login, and what the client wrote in feedback and reviews. Deleting
the `leads` row alone leaves every bit of that behind, still pointing at somebody who
is gone: treatment slots on a physio's day list under no name, a portal account that
still signs in, a reminder chasing a fee for nobody. So the lead and its whole trail
go in one call, and the list of collections lives here — one place, read by the single
delete, the branch bulk delete and the org-wide hard delete alike, so the three can
never drift into cleaning up different amounts.

**The switch.** A delete this complete is not something a branch desk should be able to
reach on an ordinary Tuesday without somebody having decided so, and which installs
want it reachable is a question that changes. So it is a developer setting — Super
Admin > Pipeline Stages > Danger Zone — rather than a role: the answer is about this
install, not about a job title. It is on unless switched off, because installs that
predate the switch already had the button and a missing row has to read as the
behaviour they already had.
