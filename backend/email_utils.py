"""Outbound email, and the one place that knows whether this install can send any.

Read at import rather than per call, which is safe because `database` — imported first by
server.py — is what calls load_dotenv, so the .env is on os.environ before this module is
reached. Changing a credential still needs a restart, which is how every other setting on
this backend behaves.

Two things a caller needs to tell apart, because the fix for each is different and the
person reading the message is usually not the person who can apply it:

    SmtpNotConfigured   no credentials on this server. Nothing is wrong with the request
                        and retrying will never help — somebody has to set SMTP_USER and
                        SMTP_PASSWORD in backend/.env and restart.
    SmtpSendFailed      credentials exist and the send still failed: Gmail refused the
                        app password, the port is blocked, the address bounced. Worth
                        retrying, and worth reading the log line for.

Before this, both arrived as a bare RuntimeError and the actual SMTP error was swallowed
by whoever caught it — so "could not send" was the whole of what anybody knew, on a
failure whose cause is written plainly in the exception.
