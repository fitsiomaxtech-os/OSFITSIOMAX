"""How long each Physiotherapy consultation package runs.

Unit tests, like the files beside this one. What this module decides is how much of a
physio's day one appointment takes, and both ways of being wrong are quiet: too short and
the next patient is booked on top of the one still in the room, too long and a slot nobody
needed is held shut every time the package is sold.

The figure most worth pinning is the one that looks wrong: Consultation + 1 Session is 45
minutes, not 45 plus a session, because the session is booked separately and no session in
this system carries a length to add. That is a decision, not an oversight, so it is written
down as a test — otherwise the next person to read it fixes it.

Nothing here touches a database. See backend/consultation_packages.py.
