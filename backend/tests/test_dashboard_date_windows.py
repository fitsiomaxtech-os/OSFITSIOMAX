"""Which day a dashboard figure is counted on.

The only tests here that need no server: the date-window helpers are pure, and the two
of them are the whole reason a single row of cards can disagree with itself. Every board
sends a plain calendar day and means the clinic's day; the fields it lands on are stored
on two different clocks (see the comment above the helpers in routers/v3_dashboard.py),
and getting that wrong is what put six sessions on a day that also reported no money and
nobody seen.

Twice before, figures on this row were fixed by a commit that had nothing to check it
against -- see "Stop counting login tokens as booked sessions" and "Fix two wrong figures
on the analytics cards". This is that check.
