    to dedupe against — 26 of the 29 physio records in the db_backup snapshot carry none —
    so the branch sync in HR cannot see what is already there and adds another beside it.

    Collapsed on the NAME within a branch and a desk, not on user_id, for the reason the
    Nutritionist picker in routers/v3_diet.py collapses the same way: the pair this exists
    to merge is exactly one linked row and one legacy row carrying no link, so keying on
    that id gives them different keys and merges nothing. Branch and profile_type stay in
    the key, so two different branches keep their own rows and a physio is never folded
    into a nutritionist of the same name.

    Two genuinely different physios sharing a name at one branch would merge. The pickers
    this feeds show the name and nothing else, so they are already indistinguishable in
    them; nothing legible is lost that was not already lost.

    The row kept is the one carrying the most published hours, then the one patients are

    Published hours lead for the same reason they lead in team_roster_experts, which
    answers this question for the calendars: the id that survives here is the id the picker
    opens a calendar on and then writes into `sessions.physio_id`, so keeping the empty
    twin offers a physio whose next screen has no date to pick. Ranking the two lists the
    same way is also what keeps them agreeing — a branch that publishes days onto one
    record and books against another has split one physio's diary in half.

    Bookings break the tie beneath that, where two rows are equally empty and only one
    holds the patients, so the sessions already filed stay with the record that survives.

    Nothing is merged or deleted. This is a read-side answer to records that already
