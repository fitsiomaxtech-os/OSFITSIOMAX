"""What a sheet column can be mapped onto, and how a mapped row becomes a lead.

One module for both halves on purpose. The mapping dropdown offers a list of fields, and
the importer writes the fields it is given, and those two lists have to be the same list:
a field the dropdown offers but the importer does not know how to write is a mapping
somebody sets, saves, and silently never receives. Keeping the catalogue and the
translation in the same file is what stops them drifting apart.

The catalogue mirrors the Create Lead form -- both of its tabs. Lead Details is who the
patient is; Lead Data is the ad record behind them (see V3LeadData in schemas/v3.py),
which only Super Admin ever sees. Custom questions are appended by the caller from
`custom_lead_fields`, so a question added on the form is mappable from a sheet the moment
it exists.
