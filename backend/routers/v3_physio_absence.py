"""A physio who will not be in, and what happens to the patients booked with them.

Marking a *patient* absent is old news here (v3_physio_board.physio_mark_absent). This is
the other half: the physio is the one away. Their patients are still coming, still owed
the day they paid for, and the physio's calendar is the only place anybody would notice
that nobody will be in the room to see them.

So an absence is a date against a physio, and it comes with a worklist: every treatment
and rehab day booked with them on that date. Each one is settled one of two ways, both
of them with the patient on the phone first —

  * handed to another physio at the same branch who has published the same hour and
    still has a seat in it. The day's physio_id moves, so it lands on the covering
    physio's board, calendar and seat count exactly as any other booking would; where it
    came from is kept on the row (covered_for_*) so it is not mistaken for a transfer.
  * released, when the patient would rather wait for their own physio. The day loses its
    slot and joins the days waiting on a date — the queue Missed Classes already works —
    so the package is not shortened by a day the patient never refused.

Both desks can do all of it. The physio knows first that they will be off; the Branch
Admin is the one who hears it at 7am on the phone. A physio can only mark and settle
their own absences; a Branch Admin, any physio at their branch.
