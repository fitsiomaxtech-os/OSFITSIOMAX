# How this branch takes money. One set, for every fee it collects.
#
# There used to be two. The Treatment Fee could be taken as Cash, UPI, Card, an Account
# Transfer, a Cheque or a Partial Payment schedule; the Consultation, Diet, Diet Chart and
# Rehab fees could only be taken as the first four. That is not a rule about those fees --
# nobody decided a rehab course may not be paid by cheque -- it is only the order the
# endpoints happened to be written in, with the later one learning things the earlier ones
# were never told. A desk that can take a cheque for one fee can take a cheque, and a
# patient who asks to spread a Rs.8000 treatment package over three dates will ask the same
# of a Rs.4000 rehab course.
#
# So the Treatment Fee's way is the way, and every fee is settled through
# settle_standard_payment below: the same six modes, the same splits, the same discount and
# balance rules, the same cash count, the same schedule. The two names remain as aliases
# because other modules import them; both now mean this.

    Every fee in this file used to work the gap between the price and the amount out as a
    discount. That reads a part payment as a write-off: a desk taking Rs.750 of a Rs.1000
    fee cancelled the Rs.250 the patient was coming back with, and nothing was left on the
    record to collect. A discount is only ever `discount_in` — a figure somebody typed —
    and whatever the amount falls short of the price is a balance, returned here as an
    unpaid installment for the caller to store on the fee's own payment_details. That is
    the same shape a Partial Payment schedule uses, so Payment Schedules, Outstanding
    Amount and the client's own panel read it for free, and it can be collected later
    under any payment mode.

    Shared by all five collect endpoints rather than restated in each, because restating
    it in each is how the same mistake came to be in all five.

    `list_price` is what the discount comes off. `total_price` is the whole bill the
    balance is measured against, and defaults to `list_price` — they differ only for the
    Treatment Fee, where a collection can cover some of a package's sessions: the discount
    is measured against those sessions, the balance against the package.

    `allow_discount` is False for the modes that cannot negotiate one (Cheque and Partial
    Payment keep their locked price), which also stops a discount arriving on a payload
