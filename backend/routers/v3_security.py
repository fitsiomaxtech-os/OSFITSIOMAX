"""SECURITY — the fourth tab of everybody's own page, and the only one that changes a login.

    Password        change my own, knowing the old one
    Two-factor      a code to my email at every sign-in, on or off
    Devices         where this account is signed in, and a way to end the rest

Like /me/profile and /me/attendance beside it, nothing here takes an id. Every endpoint
answers for whoever holds the token, so there is no request shape on this router that can
read or change another person's login — which is what makes it safe to hand to every role
at once. HR's side of the same subject (setting somebody else's password, deactivating an
account) stays where it was, on /hr/users, behind HR's roles.

Turning 2FA on or off both require a code to the registered address, not just the
session. A session is whoever is sitting at the desk; the mailbox is the person. Without
that, walking past an unlocked screen is enough to remove somebody's second factor, which
would make the feature worth less than the checkbox that draws it.

Changing a password ends every other session but this one. A password is usually changed
because somebody else may have had it, and leaving the old tokens live means the change
did nothing for the case it was made for.
