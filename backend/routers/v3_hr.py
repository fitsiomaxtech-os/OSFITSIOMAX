# the person runs — physio, fitness, both, or the online arm. They hold the same board and
# the same reach over one branch. See BRANCH_ADMIN_ROLES in deps.py for why these are fixed
# slugs listed here rather than custom roles: a role whose name is typed by hand cannot be
# aliased to branch_admin safely.
#
# "online_physio" is the same idea one rung down: a Physio who treats over video, on the
# Physio board with the Physio's reach. See PHYSIO_ROLES in deps.py.
#
# "consultant"/"online_consultant" are the consultation desk. They replaced
# "head_physio"/"online_head_physio", which are deliberately absent from this list: a
# designation is a role here and CONSULTANT is the title HR's structure actually carries,
# so those two slugs can no longer be assigned to anybody. Existing accounts on them are
# rewritten by migrate_consultant_roles() in seed.py and both slugs stay recognised in
# HEAD_PHYSIO_ROLES so nothing is locked out in the meantime.
#
# "sales_head" is Pre-Sales' own manager: the same board and the same leads, just the
# org-wide Master View instead of one rep's own book. See PRE_SALES_ROLES in deps.py.
#
# Branch Admin is one entry, not four. The three variants naming a practice —
# branch_admin_physio, _fitness, _physio_fitness — held exactly plain branch_admin's
# permissions, so all four spellings did was ask whoever was filling this form to pick
# between names that behaved identically. Existing accounts are rewritten by
# migrate_branch_admin_roles() in seed.py and the slugs stay recognised in
# BRANCH_ADMIN_ROLES so nothing is locked out in the meantime. The two online admins stay:
# those name the arm, and the online branches are a genuinely separate vertical.
#
# Ordered next to the role each is an alias of, because this list is what the Designation
# and Create User dropdowns render, and a reader picking between them wants the family
# together.
# "hr_admin", "nutritionist" and "zumba" are fixed slugs here rather than roles somebody
# types. All three were created by hand in Credentials, which meant the OS had to guess at
# the wording — is_hr_role, is_diet_role and is_zumba_role in deps.py each match a bag of
# tokens because of it, and this install still ended up with `diet_manage`, a slug the Diet
# board was never written against, whose user logged in to a blank screen. They are
# permanent desks in HR's structure, so they are named once here and matched exactly like
# every other desk. The loose predicates stay as the safety net for accounts the migration
# has not reached; migrate_designation_roles() in seed.py rewrites them.
#
# Ordered by the department each belongs to, because this list is what the Designation and
# Create User dropdowns render, and HR's own structure groups them the same way.
