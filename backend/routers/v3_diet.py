"""Diet Consultation — the third service vertical, alongside Consultations and Sessions.

Shaped deliberately like the physio side, because it is the same pattern a third time:

    Head Physio  -> consultation      -> `appointments`
    Physio       -> treatment days    -> `sessions`
    Nutrition Coach -> check-in days  -> `diet_sessions`     <- this file

One Nutrition Coach does both halves — the diet consultation AND the check-in days that
follow it. That is the one place diet departs from physio, where a senior consults and a
junior delivers. It has a consequence: there is no senior above the coach, so there is no
review chain here, and none is faked.

WHY diet check-ins live in their own collection, not in `sessions` with a discriminator:

`sessions` is read in several places by physio_id or lead_id with no filter on what kind
of session a row is. The clearest is v3_reviews._treatment_days, which counts every
completed row for a lead to decide when a physio is due a review — diet rows landing there
would fire a physio's week-one review after four physio days and three diet check-ins. The
physio calendar, the treatment-day grid and the Physio Master View counts read it the same
way. Adding a `track` field would mean auditing every one of those and every query written
after today. A separate collection makes that mistake impossible rather than merely
avoided, which matters because v3_reviews' own module docstring records that this exact
class of mistake in this exact collection has already taken the OS down once.

    v3_consult_appointments books a Head Physio's. That is what makes it show up on the
    coach's own calendar without a second mechanism to keep in step.

    Two rules this deliberately does not enforce, because the branch decides them:

    Diet normally follows treatment, but a patient can come for a diet consultation and
    nothing else — so this never requires a physio assignment or a treatment package.

    And it is never compulsory: nothing here reads or requires `diet_recommended`. The flag
    is set as a RESULT of booking, so the coach's queue agrees with the booking whether the
    Head Physio recommended diet on the day or the patient asked for it a week later.

    One rule it does enforce, and the only one: the Diet Consultation Fee has to be in
    first — see _require_diet_fee. That is not a rule about who referred the patient, which
    is why it sits beside the two above rather than contradicting them. It is a rule about
    what has been paid for, and booking a coach's hour against nothing is the mistake the
    branch cannot undo by editing a flag afterwards.

    What it must never do is touch `stage`, `branch_stage` or `consultation_stage`. The
    generic book-appointment endpoint resets a lead to the first sales stage, which for a
    patient already at Fee Collected would throw away their whole consultation. That is

#

# whatever the coach already prepares it in, and asking them to retype it into a textarea
# would produce a worse chart more slowly. The bytes go through the same `lead_documents`
# storage every other client document uses — outside the static mount, reachable only
# through an authenticated route — rather than a second store with its own path handling to
# get wrong.
#
# Sending and showing are two different acts, deliberately. The coach may prepare and send
# a chart before the fee is collected, and it lands here complete; what the fee buys is the
# patient's sight of it. So nothing on this side asks about money, and the Client Portal
# asks about nothing else.
