"""Fitness (gym) memberships, per branch — Branch Admin > Fitness.

The gym's own roll: who is a member, what they bought off the Fitness shelf, what they
have paid, and whether they are currently training, on leave, or gone.

Modelled on the Zumba desk next to it, and deliberately not folded into it. Zumba carries
a referral pipeline, masters who own a class roll, and a revenue share; the gym has none
of those — it has memberships that run out and need renewing. Sharing one collection would
mean every Zumba query filtering out gym rows and every gym query filtering out students,
and the first feature either one grew would have to be excluded from the other by hand.

What it does share is the branch scoping, because that rule is about who may read what and
should not have two answers in one OS.

# drawer is emptied in. The same four the Zumba desk takes: the 2000 is out of circulation,
# and nobody counts a membership out in fives, tens or twenties.
#
# Anything not listed here is dropped when a payment is settled, so a count in a note this
# desk does not take cannot quietly become part of the total. A payment recorded before this
# keeps whatever it was counted in -- the list governs what may be entered, not what has
