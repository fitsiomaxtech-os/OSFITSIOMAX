    reach another branch's patient. Ids that fall outside are reported as such rather than

    A lead carrying paid-for history is refused. Treatment sessions and collected payments
    point back at the lead, so deleting one empties a figure the finance board has already
    reported and orphans a patient's treatment record. Clearing junk from an import is what
    this is for, and junk has no history — anything that does is a real patient, whatever
    stage it is sitting in. Those come back named so the refusal is actionable.
