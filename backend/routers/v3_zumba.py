"""Zumba registrations for a branch.

Zumba is sold alongside the clinic's own verticals but is not a clinical journey: nobody
is consulted, treated or discharged, so it never belonged in the leads pipeline where
every row carries a branch_stage and a consultation decision. It gets its own small
collection and its own tab.

What the branch actually wants to know is where the registrations came from, so the
summary is a split by source. A referral names the master who made it, which is why the
masters are listed one by one rather than sitting behind a single "Masters" option: the
question asked of a referral is always which master, and a name typed once is offered from
then on. Fee's Collected sits among the source cards counting the registrations whose
money is actually in, which is a different question from how many registered.

Money is stored on the registration rather than in the finance ledger: a Zumba fee is a
flat class fee with no package, no installments and no consultation behind it, and putting
it through the leads' fee machinery would have meant inventing a lead to hang it on.
