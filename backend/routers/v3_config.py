    the logins posted to this branch, filtered by the role predicate for the desk. The
    calendars read `doctors`: the expert records, which are a separate collection written
    at hiring, at a Team posting, and by half a dozen other paths. A person on one and not
    the other is invisible to whichever list they are missing from — which is how an online
    branch came to show three Consultants on Team and an empty Consultant Calendar.

    So the roster is read Team's way, and the expert record is looked up per person rather
    than being the thing listed. Where somebody on the roster has no record, one is made
    here: the record is not the fact of employment, it is the sheet their published hours
    are written on, and there is no reason for a person Team already says works this desk
    to be missing one. Making it on read is what lets a calendar that was empty this
    morning simply work, without anybody being told to go and re-post staff who are
    already posted.

    A Consultant's record stays branchless and is found without one, because they hold a
    SINGLE calendar however many branches they take consultations at — two records would
    mean two independent clash checks and the same person booked into one hour twice. Every
    other desk holds a separate calendar per branch and is matched with the branch on it.

    Inactive logins are dropped, which is the one place this deliberately parts company
    with the Team tab. Team keeps them on purpose — it is the screen that switches somebody
