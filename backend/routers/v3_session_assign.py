# leaves the last day of the course with nowhere to go. It is flagged needs_assignment and
# lands here: the Physio can move days along the slots already bought, but only the Branch
# Admin puts a day onto the physio's published calendar, which is where it came from in the
# first place. Until this is done the patient is a day short of the package they paid for.


# A physio runs two courses out of the same room, and each names the same two facts
# differently: a treatment day is session_number of total_sessions, a rehab day is
# day_number of total_days. Marking a patient absent already writes needs_assignment to
# whichever collection the day came from, but only `sessions` was ever read back — so a
# rehab day stranded by an absence was owed to the patient and shown to nobody, which is
# the one thing this queue exists to stop. Both are read here and flattened onto the
# treatment names once, at the read, so everything downstream sees a single shape.

    What that means depends on what was bought. A treatment day and a rehab day were paid

    place in the course and goes back to the days waiting on a date — the same state an
    absence leaves behind, read by `/branch/sessions/unscheduled` and by the Physio board.
    Cancelling it outright would quietly shorten a package the patient has already paid for.
