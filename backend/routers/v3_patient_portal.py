"""Client Portal — a login (phone or email + password) Branch Admin generates for a patient
once their Treatment Fee is paid, so the patient can check their own session progress
without staff involvement.

Phone is the login everyone has; email is the second way in, to the same account. Several
patients may sit behind one login — a family registered on one number — so an account is
still one per patient, a password is shared across every account on the same phone or
email, and signing in hands back every patient the password opened for the patient to pick
between (see _start_portal_session and /patient-portal/switch).

Kept in its own patient_portal_accounts / patient_portal_sessions collections rather than
reusing `users`/`sessions` — those are staff-only, and `sessions` already carries a second,
unrelated shape (treatment-session bookings, deliberately, per v3_reviews.py's docstring
about what happened the last time this collection grew a second shape); a third shape on
top of that is exactly the mistake to avoid, not repeat.

    is the point: the generic route decides by is_shared_with_patient, which is a flag on a
    row and cannot see what has been paid. This one re-reads the fee off the lead and
    refuses without it, so the gate holds on the bytes and not only on the screen that links
    to them.

    Takes no parameters at all. `lead_id` comes from the session token, and which chart is
    "the" chart is decided here rather than by the caller — there is nothing to pass, and so
    nothing to pass that belongs to somebody else.

    The same 404 whether the fee is unpaid or no chart exists. Which of the two it is tells
    a patient something about their own file that the portal has already said properly in
    the diet block; repeating it here as the difference between two error codes is just a
    way to probe.
