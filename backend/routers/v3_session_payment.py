"""Paid sessions running out — telling the branch when a client's treatment has used up
what they have paid for.

A Treatment Fee can be collected for only some of a package's sessions (12 of 14, say) with
the rest left as a balance installment on a due date. payment_reminders.py chases that
balance by date, by emailing the patient. Nothing looked at it by *session*: a client could
be given all 14 days while the balance for the last two sat unpaid, and the physio giving
them, the Branch Admin at the desk and the Accountant were never told.

So the rule here is counted in days of treatment, not calendar days:

    completed sessions >= sessions paid for, with a balance still owing  ->  "due"
    one paid session left                                                ->  "last_paid"

Worked out live from the lead and its completed sessions rather than stored, so a payment
clears the alert the moment it is collected and a client who crossed the line before this
existed (BALA TESTING, 14 given against 12 paid) shows up without a backfill.

Past that line the next treatment day is held, not just flagged: the physio's Complete is
refused (payment_hold_for_lead) until the balance is collected. The client can ask for more
time from their portal, and a Branch Admin can grant it — an extension moves the balance's
due date and lets the remaining days go ahead unpaid until that date.

Two ways it reaches people:
  * GET /api/v3/session-payment-alerts — the header's rupee bell, for Branch Admin (their
    branch), Super Admin, BDE and Accountant (all).
  * notify_after_session_complete — called when a physio completes a treatment day. It
    logs the crossing on the client's timeline and, on the day the paid sessions run out,
    emails the branch's admins, the accountants and the physio (when SMTP is configured).
