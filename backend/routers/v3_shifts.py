"""TIME MANAGEMENT — the shifts a branch runs, and who works which one.

Four windows come seeded (Morning, Evening, Online, Full Time) and every one of them is
editable, because clinic hours are a branch's own business. Assigning one to an expert is
what makes it real: from then on their CONSULTANT / PHYSIO / DIET calendar is only opened
across those hours.

See shift_utils for why assignment lives on the `doctors` row and why shifts are looked up
by id rather than by branch.

The same screen also sets the branch's WORKING DAY -- its hours, its grace, and which days
it is closed -- at the foot of this file. That is a different thing from a shift and the
two are easy to confuse: a shift is when patients may be booked with an expert, the working
day is when staff are expected in, and the second is what the attendance register reads to
decide whether somebody was late. See attendance_rules.py, which owns that reasoning.
