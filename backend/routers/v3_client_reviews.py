"""Client Reviews — the stars a client gives their Consultant and their Physio.

Kept apart from two things with a similar name:

  * routers/v3_reviews.py is the clinical Review pipeline, the Consultant's review of a
    patient's progress every 7 days of treatment. Nothing to do with what the client thought
    -- though a completed one is what the client's Consultant Review hangs off.
  * routers/v3_feedback.py is the client's conversation with their branch, consultant or
    head office ("Talk to Management"). That is words to be answered; this is a verdict.

Every review is its own row, with a `kind` (who is rated) and a `source` (what prompted it):

  * kind "physio", source "week" -- every 7 days of treatment (or rehab) the client rates
    their Physio: 1-5 stars and Treatment Feedback, one row per week. A week is due once
    every day in it is completed; the portal's Sessions tab then asks in a pop-up for each
    due week finished since PHYSIO_REVIEW_START. Mandatory: there is no Skip, and the
    Physio cannot Send to Review while one is owed (see weeks_owed). The Physio reads the
    stars only -- never the words (see physio_star_ratings). Weekly reviews briefly also
    rated the Consultant; those rows stay readable but are no longer asked for.
  * source "anytime" -- either kind, from the Feedback tab, whenever the client wants.
  * kind "branch_admin", source "anytime" -- the client's stars for their branch desk, from
    the Feedback tab's Branch Admin card (Review, beside Chat). Rated against the branch,
    not one login: `branch_id` is who it is about, and HR Performance credits it to every
    Branch Admin posted there.
  * source "session" / "review" -- the earlier per-session Physio and per-clinical-Review
    Consultant rows. No longer written, still read by management.

Rows written by the first flow (one row per client with both ratings, no `kind`) are still
read by management: list_client_reviews splits each into its consultant and physio halves.

Read by management only: Super Admin and BDE across every branch, a Branch Admin for their
own branch. BDE is admitted by BDE_ROLES rather than the one slug: the Business Development
Executive is `business_dev`, but a login created before migrate_designation_roles ran still
holds the typed `business_development_executive` (see DEFAULT_ROLES in routers/v3_hr.py),
and that desk reads these figures for the company.
