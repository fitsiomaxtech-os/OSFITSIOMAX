"""Post-treatment Review pipeline.

A patient who has been in treatment for a week is due a Head Physio review. The chain
runs Physio -> Branch Admin -> Head Physio:

    send_to_review   the Physio has raised it; it is waiting on the Branch Admin
    sent             the Branch Admin has dispatched it to a named Head Physio for a date
    completed        that Head Physio has written the review

Each board reads the same records through its own lens: Branch Admin sees the whole
branch, a Head Physio sees only what was dispatched to them.

This lives in its own `reviews` collection rather than on `weekly_assessments`. That one
is keyed (lead_id, week_number) and already carries its own physio->head-physio flow with
no dispatch step; bolting a second state machine onto it would give one collection two
unrelated shapes — exactly what the `sessions` collection did before it took the OS down.

    A Head Physio assigned to several branches has one doctors record per branch, so this
    matches on every record linked to their login rather than a single doctor id.

    `branch_id` switches that to the branch's whole Consultant queue, which is what a
    Super Admin driving somebody else's board in Operations > Consultant needs. Matching
    on the caller's own doctors records is right for a Consultant reading their own board
    and useless for a supervisor: a Super Admin has no consultant record, so the queue
    came back empty and a review a Branch Admin had just dispatched appeared nowhere —
    while the Consultations list beside it, which has always been branch-scoped, showed
    the same branch's work fine.

    Undispatched reviews are deliberately left out: `head_physio_id` is what makes a review
    somebody's to write, and the ones still waiting on a Branch Admin belong to Branch
    Admin > Review > Send to Review, not to a Consultant's queue.
