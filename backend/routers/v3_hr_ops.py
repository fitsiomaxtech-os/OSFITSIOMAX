"""HR's running month: attendance, approvals, payroll, and the quote board.

Four desks that share one set of records. They are written together because they are not
independent of each other -- an approved leave is an attendance mark, and attendance is
what payroll pro-rates a salary against -- and keeping them apart would have meant three
copies of the rule that decides whether a day is paid.

The chain runs one way, so each desk can be read without knowing the next:

    Approvals  ->  Attendance  ->  Payroll

An approved leave writes the days it covers into attendance as `leave`; attendance's
loss-of-pay days are what payroll deducts. Nothing runs backwards: deleting a payroll run
leaves attendance alone, and revoking an approval only clears the marks that approval put
there (see `_clear_marks`).

A permission -- hours off inside a working day rather than the day itself -- runs down the
same chain and stops one link short of pay. It lands on the register beside the day's
marks, saying which hours were agreed and why, and deliberately does not set a status: the
person came in, and a two-hour errand is not a deduction. See `_apply_permission_mark`.

Requests reach the first link by two roads. HR logs one on somebody's behalf, which is how
a phone call at seven in the morning gets recorded; or the person raises their own, from
their profile, which is routers/v3_me.py -- a different door onto this same
collection, with `build_request` here shaping the row for both.

One thing feeds in from outside that chain: the clock in the header, which every person
presses for themselves (routers/v3_clock.py). It writes the times and the breaks onto the
register's rows, so the In and Out columns are what people actually pressed rather than
somebody's recollection of when they arrived. The marks stay HR's -- a clocked-in day is
`present` only where nobody has said otherwise, and absent, half and leave are decisions
this file has always left to a person.

Lives beside routers/v3_hr.py rather than inside it. Same URL prefix -- these are all
/api/v3/hr to whoever is calling -- but that file is the org's *structure* (who exists,
what department they sit in, what they may log in to), which changes when the company
changes shape, and this one is the month, which changes every day.

Salary figures pass through here. Every endpoint is Super Admin or HR, the same two who
can already read `net_salary` off the employee record in the Employees tab.
