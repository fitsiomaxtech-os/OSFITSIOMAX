    """The expert records belonging to the physio who is logged in, and which to open on.

    A physio's board starts from a LOGIN and has to find the `doctors` record it belongs
    to. Assign Physio never does: it writes the id of a record taken straight from the
    branch's expert list into sessions.physio_id and leads.assigned_physio_id, and never
    needs the login at all. Two ends of the same link -- and they part company the moment
    one person holds more than one record.

    They routinely do. Half a dozen paths mint these records and most carry no user_id to
    dedupe against -- 26 of the 29 physio records in the db_backup snapshot have none --
    so HR's branch sync cannot see what is already there and adds another beside it.
    collapse_duplicate_experts exists because Assign Physio was offering one physio three
    times over.

    This resolver was a find_one on user_id with an employee_id fallback, so it landed on
    at most one of those records, and on none at all where none of them carried the link.
    Every endpoint hanging off it then answered {"patients": []} and the board read 0
    across every tile with nothing on screen to say why -- which is exactly what "I
    assigned the physio and their master view is empty" looks like from the inside.

    So every record the person holds is collected, and the reads are scoped to all of them
    rather than to one. Which record the branch happened to book against stops mattering,
    and nothing is stranded on a twin: the physio sees their patients whichever of their
    own records the days were filed under.

    Three routes in, each tried only when the one before it finds nothing:

      1. doctors.user_id == the login's id -- the link, where it was ever written.
      2. users.employee_id -> doctors.employee_id -- the profile-only rows Fitsiomax
         Experts creates carry no user_id, but do carry the employee they were made for.
      3. the person's own name, among records carrying NO user_id at all.

    The third answers the common state, and it is fenced: a record already linked to
    another login is never claimed, so the wrong answer needs two physios of one name with
    an unlinked record between them. That is the trade collapse_duplicate_experts already
    makes when it merges on the name, for the reason it gives -- the pickers show a name
    and nothing else, so two of them were already indistinguishable there. Records at the
    person's own branch are preferred where any answer, so a namesake elsewhere loses to
    the physio actually standing there.

    Read-only. Nothing is merged, deleted or linked here: moving bookings between records
    is not a repair a page load should be making, and which record is the one to keep is a
    question about the data rather than about the code -- tools/physio_board_check.py
    answers it on the server.

    The record RETURNED is the survivor collapse_duplicate_experts would keep, so the board
    opens on the same row Assign Physio offers and the branch publishes hours against: its
    slots are the calendar, and its id is what a new assessment is filed under. The whole
    set rides along on `physio_ids`, which is what the reads scope by.
