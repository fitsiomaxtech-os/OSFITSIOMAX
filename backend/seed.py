    """Give a Consultant's login back the branches their employee record already names.

    The other half of making a Consultant branch-selective, and the half that had nothing
    to read. Where a Consultant works is decided on their employee record and cascaded to
    the login, which is what every branch-scoped list reads. But consolidate_head_physio_
    doctors cleared those logins at every startup for as long as Consultants were org-wide,
    so on an install upgrading into selective branches every Consultant login is blank
    while their employee row still says Anna Nagar or Tirchy.

    The result was a Consultant Calendar, a booking popup and a Team roster that were all
    empty at every branch, with the branch plainly printed two screens away in HR. Nothing
    was lost — the answer was on the employee all along — and this copies it back across.

    Only ever fills a login that has NO branches at all. A Consultant somebody has since
    posted, or deliberately taken off every branch by clearing it on the employee record
    (which cascades, so both halves go blank together), is left exactly as it is. That is
    what keeps this safe to run at every startup rather than once: after the first pass
    there is nothing blank left to fill, and it can never re-post somebody who was unposted
    on purpose, because unposting clears the employee too.

    ALL_BRANCHES is expanded rather than copied. An employee covering everything carries
    that marker; a Consultant covering everything now has to name the branches, because an
    empty list on a login means nowhere and no longer means everywhere. A branch added
    later will not be picked up — that is the honest consequence of a selective model,
    and it is visible and fixable on the row rather than silent.

    Consultants only. They are the one desk whose branches were being erased; every other
    role's login has carried its own all along.

    The employee is found by the link where there is one and BY NAME where there is not.
    That second path is not an edge case: employee_id on a login is optional, the two
    screens are filled in months apart, and _consultants_for_vertical already carries the
    same fallback for the same reason. Without it this function skipped exactly the people
    it was written for — HR printing Parrys Branch on the employee row while the login
    stayed blank and the Consultant Calendar stayed empty — because the only thing tying
    the two halves together was the link that was missing.

    A name is only accepted when it resolves to exactly ONE employee whose designation
    reads as this desk. A name shared by two people says nothing about which of them holds
    the login, and a namesake in another department is not this person at all, so an
    ambiguous match is dropped rather than guessed.

    Where a name resolves, the link itself is written back alongside the branches. The
    branches alone would be a repair with a short life: the next time HR moved that
    Consultant the cascade would look for the login by employee_id, fail to find it again,
    and the two halves would part exactly as before.

    folded, so any difference in spacing or punctuation slipped through, and PUT
    .../designations/order compared the submitted list with the stored one as SETS, which
    cannot see a repeat at all. Both are tightened in routers/v3_hr.py; this is the sweep

    The first spelling wins, because it is the one every earlier record was written

    pass — dropping the name without moving the people would leave an employee pointing at
    a designation the department no longer lists, which is a record that filters to nothing
    on the Employees tab and counts toward no designation on the Dashboard.

    Only ever removes a repeat of a title the department already holds. A title held once
    is never touched, and no title moves between departments — where a job belongs is a
    decision about the org, not one a migration should take.
