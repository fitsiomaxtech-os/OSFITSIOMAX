# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Branch ("sales") stages
#
# The Branch pipeline is not the same shape for every branch: a branch running its own
# leads (Lead Control = Branch Admin) opens at "Branch Assign" and has an RNR stage, while
# a branch fed by the Pre-Sales desk opens at "New Appointment" and has neither. Both live
# in the one `sales` stage list, told apart by `applies_to` — see constants.py.
#
# Everything that reads or writes a lead's branch_stage must go through these, because the
# entry stage is no longer a single global name. Writing the wrong mode's entry stage onto
# a lead orphans it exactly the way a stale hardcoded literal does: the lead still counts
# in the branch total but sits on a stage that branch's board never renders.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- The two Branch arms
#
# The second axis, alongside Lead Control above. The clinic runs an offline practice and an
# online one, and they do not work a lead the same way — so each arm has its own Branch Lead
# pipeline, edited on its own tab in CI/CD ROOTS and stamped `arm` on the stage row.
#
# Which arm a record belongs to is read from its `vertical`, never stored twice: an online
# admin's role names the arm, an online lead's vertical does, and a branch's vertical does.
# See seed.ensure_sales_arm_split for how the two lists came to exist.
#
# A stage with no `arm` belongs to both, which is what every stage was before the split —
# so a database mid-upgrade reads as shared rather than as two empty pipelines.
