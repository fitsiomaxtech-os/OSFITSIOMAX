# The Branch ("sales") pipeline is one shared list, but its opening stages depend on who
# works the lead first — see lead_control. A sales stage may carry an `applies_to` of
# "pre_sales" or "branch_admin" to appear only for branches under that Lead Control;
# a stage with no `applies_to` (the default, and every stage that shipped before this)
# belongs to both and is what the bulk of the pipeline stays.
#
# A branch on Pre-Sales control opens at "New Appointment" — the lead was already worked
# and qualified by the Pre-Sales desk, so it arrives as a booked appointment. A branch
# running its own leads has done none of that yet: the lead is raw, so it opens at
# "Branch Assign" and gets an RNR stage for the calls that go unanswered, mirroring the
# Pre-Sales desk's own New Leads -> RNR -> Follow Up shape.

# agree -- the seed that creates the pill, the stage move that frees the slot, and the

# The clinic runs two practices — one in the room, one over video — and they do not work a

# and pretending the difference is cosmetic. The stage row carries `arm`; which arm a record
# belongs to is read off its vertical (see stage_utils.sales_arm_for).

# A handful of Branch stages are not just positions on a strip: the board opens the booking
# dialog on one, frees the consultation slot on another, and hides a third from the pills
# because it is reached by its own dialog. Every one of those behaviours used to be written
# as a comparison against the stage's *name*, on both sides of the wire — which meant Super
# Admin renaming the stage in CI/CD ROOTS silently detached the behaviour from the stage.
# Renaming "Appointment Date & Time" did not rename a label; it stopped appointments being
# bookable, and the booking endpoint rejected the move outright (see its final_stage check).
#
# So the behaviour hangs off a `role` stamped on the stage document instead. The name is
# then Super Admin's to change: the role travels with the row through a rename, and every
# site that has to recognise the stage asks for the role and gets whatever it is called now.
#
# This map is only the initial stamping, applied by name once to stages that predate the
# field (see seed.ensure_sales_stage_roles). It is not consulted at runtime — a stage that
# already carries a role is never re-matched against these names.

#
# The rename is not cosmetic. This is where a lead lands the moment Branch Leads books its
# appointment, and while it was called "Follow Up" it shared a name with the Branch
# ("sales") pipeline's own Follow Up stage — which meant the Consultation tab dropped it
# from its pill bar (one name, one pill, kept on the Branch side; see
# consultationOnlyStages in BranchAdminBoard.jsx). Every freshly booked patient therefore
# sat on a stage that tab had no pill for: in the list, counted in All Stages, and under
# none of the cards above it. A name of its own gives the stage a pill of its own.
