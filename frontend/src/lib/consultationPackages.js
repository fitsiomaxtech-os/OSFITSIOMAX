/**
 * The three packages a Physiotherapy consultation is sold as.
 *
 * Read in two places that must agree: Services & Products, where a package is created and
 * its length previewed, and the Consultation Fee desk, where one is picked and its price
 * collected. Kept here rather than in either screen so neither imports the other — and so
 * there is one list to change when a fourth package appears.
 *
 * Mirrors PACKAGES in backend/consultation_packages.py. `minutes` is the default length the
 * create form pre-fills; Super Admin can edit it per item, and the stored duration_minutes
 * is what gets booked. A test (backend/tests/test_consultation_packages.py)
 * reads this file back and fails if the two lists disagree, because a preview promising 65
 * minutes while the server stores 45 would surface as a physio's afternoon running over
 * rather than as anything on screen.
