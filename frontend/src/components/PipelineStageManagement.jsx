// ------------------------------------------------- What the Branch Leads strip actually draws
//
// This table listed the Branch pipeline whole, which is seven rows -- and the board's strip
// draws five of them. Reading one against the other, the two extra entry stages and the
// final one looked like stages the branch had lost rather than stages the board reaches
// another way, and there was nothing on this screen to say which was which.
//
// So the Branch tab is split in two: the rows the strip draws, in strip order, and the rows
// it does not, under a divider. The rule below is the board's own -- see leadPillStages in
// BranchAdminBoard.jsx -- and has to stay the board's own, or this table goes back to
// describing something nobody can see. Three rows never reach the strip:
//
//   - the Pre-Sales-control entry stage ("New Appointment"), which a branch running its own
//     leads does not have at all (`applies_to`);
//   - the branch's own entry stage ("Branch Assign"), whose pill is the mirror row below;
//   - the Portfolio stage and the final one ("Cancelled"), both reached from their own
//     dialogs rather than from the strip.
//
// Listed rather than dropped, deliberately. They are real positions carrying real leads --
// Branch Assign holds the branch's whole intake -- and this is the only screen in the
// product that can rename, recolour or reorder them. Hiding them to match the strip would
// have matched the strip by making three stages unmanageable.

// there is no document behind it to edit, delete or reorder.
