 * reported: a Consultant seeing the gold star knows to treat this one especially well, a
 * Physio seeing the red flag knows something needs looking at, and neither is being asked
 * to decide it from the fraction of the branch their own board shows them.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when a patient carries neither, because these lists are long and a
 * pair of empty outlines on every row of them is noise standing in for information. The
 * editable pair in Branch Leads does the opposite, and for the opposite reason: there the
 * control has to be findable before it has ever been used.

 * and reported read-only everywhere else. The Consultant about to see this patient, and
 * the Head Physio looking at the day's calendar, both want to know the 10:30 in front of
 * them is not the time that was originally arranged; neither is being asked to decide it.
 *
 * Renders nothing when the patient has not been moved, like LeadMarks above and for the
 * same reason: an empty outline on every row of a long list is noise standing in for
 * information.
 *
 * The count shows from the second move on. One reschedule is ordinary and needs no number;
 * three is a patient who keeps not coming, and that is worth reading off the row rather

/**
 * "Transferred" — this patient came here from another branch, or has left for one.
 *
 * The third mark, and it belongs beside the other two rather than in the stage strip for
 * the same reason they do: a transferred patient is not at a stage of their own. They are
 * sitting in New Appointment or in Physio Assign exactly like everybody around them, and
 * the one thing that is not true of the row either side of theirs is that the history
 * behind them happened somewhere else.
 *
 * Which is worth a glyph on the name because of what the history costs to read otherwise.
 * The money already collected stayed in the branch they came from (revenue_branch_splits),
 * their booked treatment days were released and have to be booked again here, and their
 * Patient Number was issued by the other branch. A Branch Admin who does not know that is
 * about to wonder why a patient at Fee Collected has nothing in this branch's book.
 *
 * Set by nobody: unlike the star and the flag, this is not a judgement anyone makes about
 * a patient — it is written by the transfer itself, in BranchTransferDialog, and read here.
 *
 * Indigo, which is the colour the transfer dialog already uses for itself, and the arrow
 * it opens with. Renders nothing for a patient who has never moved, like the marks above
 * it: most patients have not, and an outline on every row of them is noise.
 *
 * The count shows from the second move on, on the same reasoning as RescheduledTag: one
 * transfer is ordinary, three is a patient nobody has settled, and that reads better off
 * the row than out of the activity log.
