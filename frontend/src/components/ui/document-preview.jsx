/**
 * A patient's document, read on the page that listed it.
 *
 * Every document route is authenticated, so the bytes arrive as a blob rather than at a
 * URL a browser can be pointed at. The obvious thing to do with the object URL that comes
 * back is hand it to window.open — and that is what the Physio board did, which took the
 * physio out of the patient they were reading and left them to find their way back
 * through browser tabs. A record you open to check against the notes beside it belongs
 * beside them, not in place of them.
 *
 * Two more things a new tab gets wrong, both of which this avoids by never opening one:
 * the open happens after an await, so the click that started it has expired by the time
 * it runs and a popup blocker can swallow it with nothing thrown to catch; and the blob
 * then has to be revoked on a guessed timer, because nothing here can know when the tab
 * is done reading it.
 *
 * Shared rather than written per board — DietBoard's chart panel already had this shape,
 * and LeadDocuments has an image-only lightbox of its own. Both can move onto this.

 * page with a document still open (the modal behind it closes, the board reloads), and an
 * object URL nobody hands back holds its bytes for the life of the tab. Deliberately not
 * revoked on a timer: the bytes live exactly as long as they are on screen, and somebody
 * reading a long report cannot have it expire underneath them.
