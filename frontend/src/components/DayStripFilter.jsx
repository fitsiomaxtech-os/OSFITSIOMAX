/**
 * DayStripFilter
 *
 * A row of single days instead of a row of ranges: All, then a window of dates
 * around today — Sep 10 … Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow … Sep 21. One tap narrows the
 * board to that one day, which is how a Consultant actually reads their queue: they
 * are looking at a day's appointments, not at a quarter's.
 *
 * It emits the same { key, label, from, to } | null shape DateFilterPopover and
 * QuickDateFilterBar emit, so a board can swap one for the other without anything
 * downstream noticing. `key` is `day_YYYY-MM-DD`, which is what isDayKey() reads —
 * a board needs to tell "a day off this strip" from "a range typed into the
 * calendar", and the dates themselves are a moving target.
 *
 * QuickDateFilterBar is deliberately left alone: five other boards still want All /
 * Today / This Week / This Month / Last 90 Days, and this is a different control
 * rather than a new version of that one.
 *
 * Props:
 *  - value: { key, label, from: Date, to: Date } | null. null means All.
 *  - onChange: (next) => void. Emits null for All.
 *  - testid: string prefix for the row's test ids.
 *  - back / forward: how many days either side of today to offer.
