 *
 * Two books, added from the two buttons above the table. Stock Detail is what gets bought
 * and at what rate, typed by hand because a purchase is known long before anybody decides
 * whether the thing is ever sold over a counter. Vendor is who supplies it, which of it
 * they supply, and what has been paid against the bill.
 *
 * Both are org-wide, exactly as the sales catalogue is: one vendor across the whole
 * organisation is what makes a spend figure add up and what lets two branches recognise
 * the same supplier. `branchId` only narrows the delivery totals on each row — a Branch
 * Admin is pinned to their own branch by the server whatever this sends, and a Super
 * Admin with none sees every branch's.
 *
 * The delivery totals, the Shelves column and the Supplies list come from somewhere else
 * entirely: the stock ledger, written by Add Stock on the shelf itself. Nothing on this
 * tab moves stock, which is why nothing on it needs to know which branch you are.
