/**
 * Lead Control — who works this branch's leads first, Pre-Sales or the Branch Admin.
 *
 * The setting lives on the branch, so the same switch appears wherever a branch is in
 * reach: the Branch Detail header, the Edit Branch dialog, and each Marketing Source
 * card (a source is tagged to a branch, and that is where leads actually arrive). All
 * three write the same field, which is why they are one component rather than three
 * lookalikes that drift apart.
 *
 * Not stamped on leads: flipping it rehomes the leads already in the pipeline as well
 * as the next import. See backend/lead_control.py for why.
 *
 * @param confirm  ask before switching. On for the two places that save on click —
 *                 moving a branch's whole book between two desks is not something to
 *                 do by brushing a control. Off inside the Edit dialog, where nothing
 *                 happens until Save Changes and a confirm would be asking about a
 *                 change that has not been made yet.
