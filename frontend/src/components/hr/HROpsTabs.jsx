/**
 * HR's running month: Attendance, Payroll, Approvals and Quotes.
 *
 * Four tabs of HR Admin, sitting straight after the Dashboard because they are the work
 * of a month rather than the shape of the company — the Employees, Credentials and
 * Department tabs after them are the org chart, which changes rarely, and these change
 * every day.
 *
 * They are one file because they are one chain, the same one their endpoints describe in
 * backend/routers/v3_hr_ops.py:
 *
 *     Approvals  ->  Attendance  ->  Payroll
 *
 * An approved leave writes itself into the register; the register's loss-of-pay days are
 * what payroll pro-rates against. Splitting them into four files would have put the three
 * screens that share those rules three imports apart, and the rules are the thing most
 * likely to be edited together.
 *
 * Kept out of HRBoard.jsx, which is already four thousand lines of the org chart. The
 * tabs are wired in there; everything they do lives here.
