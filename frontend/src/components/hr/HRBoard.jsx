 * were the same kind of thing. Grouped, the department is read first and the job second,
 * which is the order the org is actually shaped in.
 *
 * The configured list leads, not the one read back off whoever happens to hold a job
 * today. Those two answer different questions: Department & Designation says what the org
 * has, and the records say what is currently filled. A filter built from the records alone
 * cannot offer a designation nobody holds yet, which is exactly the one somebody is about
 * to hire into.
 *
 * Each designation appears once across the whole list, under the first department that
 * configures it. What gets picked is the job on its own, so a title offered under two
 * headings would be two options that filter to exactly the same people.
 *
 * Departments are walked in meta.departments order — the order Departments & Designation
 * shows them in — so the dropdown reads the same way as the tab that defines it.
 *
 * A final group collects designations that are on somebody's record but in no
 * department's configured list. Those are the ones a filter built only from the structure
 * loses, and losing one means the people holding it cannot be filtered for at all. With a
 * department chosen they join that department's own group rather than a stray second
 * heading, and "Unassigned" — which is not a department and has no configured list — is
 * only ever described this way.

 * job sits often enough that pairing the two would filter to nobody.
 *
 * Built from Popover and buttons rather than a <select>. A native select's list is drawn
 * by the browser, not by this page: the grey Windows menu, its own type size, its own
 * highlight blue, and none of it reachable from a class. Next to the sky pills it sits
 * beside, the one control that opened looked like it belonged to another application.
 * This is the panel the rest of the OS opens — white card, sky highlight, and the
 * department headings set in the same small caps section labels use elsewhere in this
 * file. Popover carries the parts that are genuinely hard: it portals out, so a filter
 * near the bottom of a card is not clipped by it, and it closes on Escape and on a click
 * outside.
 *
 * The trigger shows a value the list does not offer. A filter can arrive here already set
 * — a Dashboard card or a department bar opens this page on one — and it can be a
 * spelling of a job the structure holds in different capitals. Reading "All Designations"
 * over a list that is filtered is the one state a filter must never show.

/**
 * The ROLE cell's picker: one neutral style for the closed box and every row, with the
 * row matching the current value as the only thing highlighted, so which one is picked
 * reads from the highlight rather than from a palette. Same treatment RoleSelectDropdown
 * gives the designation picker.
 *
 * Still built rather than a native <select>, which cannot style its option list at all —
 * the browser draws that, so the rounded rows and the highlight would both be lost.
 *
 * The list is portalled to <body> and pinned to the button's own rect. This picker sits
 * inside the table's overflow-auto scroller, and a list positioned the ordinary way is
 * clipped at that container's edge for every row far enough down it — which is most of
 * them once an install has a screenful of users. It opens upward instead when the row is
 * near the bottom of the window, and closes on any scroll, since a list fixed to the
 * viewport would otherwise sit on while the button it belongs to slides away.
 */
/**
 * A picker, opened as a dialog. Used for a branch and for a role.
 *
 * A dialog rather than a panel hanging off the control: these sit deep inside a card, in a
 * row, inside a list that scrolls — any one of which can clip a panel or stack over it. A
 * dialog answers to none of them, and it has room to say whose branch or role is being
 * changed, which a strip of options beside a button never did.
 *
 * It is also the only shape that can be scrolled. A panel pinned to the viewport has to
 * close when the page moves under it, and a scroll listener that notices the page moving
 * cannot tell that apart from the list being scrolled — so the list shut the moment it was
 * used. A dialog has nothing to keep up with and simply scrolls.
 *
 * Portalled to the body for the same reason, so no ancestor's overflow or stacking context
 * can crop it.
 *
 * No colour anywhere, which was the point of replacing the native select in the first
 * place: white card, slate text, a grey wash on hover, and the current choice marked by
 * weight and a tick rather than by hue.

 * difference is the multi-branch desks being shown honestly rather than a miscount.
 *
 * Four kinds of answer, in the order they read:
 *
 *   All Branches — a posting, and the widest one, so it comes before any single branch.
 *                  Not expanded into every group: repeating one person under all of them

 *                  order as the picker that writes them.
 *   Online Mode  — only where the install runs no online branch at all. An online desk is
 *                  otherwise filed under the online branches themselves, above, in their
 *                  own place in that order rather than in a group after it.
 *   No branch    — the only real gap, and last, because it is the one to act on.
