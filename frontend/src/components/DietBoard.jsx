/**
 * Diet Master View — the Nutrition Coach's own board.
 *
 * Two tabs: the consultations to work through, and the caseload behind them. It keeps the
 * Physio Master View's shape where it still applies, so a coach moving between the two
 * boards does not have to learn a second layout.
 *
 * Two things are intentionally absent, and their absence is the design rather than an
 * omission:
 *
 *   No Review tab. On the physio side reviews exist so a junior's work gets seen by a
 *   senior. One Nutrition Coach runs the whole vertical, so there is nobody above them for
 *   a review to route to. A Review tab here would be a queue that never fills.
 *
 *   No treatment-day terminology. These are check-in days against a diet plan, counted
 *   out of diet_sessions — a separate collection from `sessions`, so nothing here can be
 *   miscounted as physio treatment (see the module docstring in backend/routers/v3_diet.py).
